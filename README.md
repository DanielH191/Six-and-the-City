## IMPORTANT
Befor starting the application we need to fix the upcomming points:  

- Change the File-Path to your chosen audio file and make the change in the  [Controller](https://github.com/DanielH191/Six-and-the-City/blob/34e77148c82c38916e2d5f04e57461c3e151f9f8/src/main/java/com/RequestController.java "RequestController.java")

- Add the API-Key for the OpenAI API in the [application.properties](https://github.com/DanielH191/Six-and-the-City/blob/34e77148c82c38916e2d5f04e57461c3e151f9f8/src/main/resources/application.properties) using the following structure:
